# Farm Central Stock Management Application
Description:
The Farm Central Stock Management Application aims to digitilize the stock management of Farm Central. It allows farmers and employees to have access to the same
application and work together in order to make the managing of stock super easy and efficient. This application will be a great help to all the employees and farmers
who are involved with Farm Central, making their lives easier. 

## Login Page
The application starts off in the login home page. From there, the user (an employee) can click the register button which will take them to the register page where they can
create an account. If the user has not logged in yet, and tries to access any part of the website, it will disable the user from using any of the websites 
features until the user has signed in. This forces the user to login everytime they open the application. They login using their:
-Username
-Password
Those values were created when they registered their account.

## Registration Page
On the registration page, not just the username and password is captured. The application also asks for:
-Full name
-Email
-Phone number
With this information, it makes the user feel more authenticated and it also allows the website developers to get into contact with that user if anything goes
wrong. It also just stores information so that we know more about the user rather than just their username and password. It creates a connection between them and
the application and it makes their time a bit more enjoyable.

## Farmer Menus
Once a farmer has logged in, They are taken to the farmer home page. From there they can click on the Product Info naviagation menu and add product information about the
products that they delivered. The information the applications asks for is:
- Product type
- Amount delivered
- Date of delivery
When this information is entered, the farmer can click the add button to add the information to the database. The farmer can also select any information that they and update
or delete it. This is implemented incase a mistake is made with the entering of the information. That is all the roles the farmer user can perform.

## Employee Menus
Once an employee logs in, they will be taken to the employee home page. From there, they can decided if they want to register a farmer or search for a farmer. When registering
a farmer, all the details that they enter are discussed above in the **Registration Page** section. In the search for a farmer page, the employee can enter any name of a farmer,
and all the farmers names that contain the words the employee typed in, will display in a table for the employee to select. Once a farmer is selected, the employee will
be able to view all the product information that that certain farmer has entered. That list can then be filtered down using 3 filters:
- Specific day of delivery
- Delivery dates between 2 chosen dates
- Certain product type
When a filter has been chosen, the user will be able to see all the product information according to that chosen filter.

That is the description of the application.

Personal opinion:
This application was my first major application I have created and designed in ASP.NET C#. It was challenging but at the same time, extremely fun.
Getting everything to work properly and seeing the application run smoothly was a very satisfying experience and I hope to feel the feeling
more often when I work on even bigger projects. That reason is one of the many reasons I got into coding and decided to study it as well. 
Overall I really enjoyed working on this project and I cannot wait for the challenging projects that are presented to me in the future. I hope
your experience of running my application is as fun as my experience creating it.
